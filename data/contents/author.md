Welcome to my homepage!

I am a theoretical material scientist based at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin.

I mainly use density function theory (DFT) calculations, machine learning models, tight-binding models, and other theoretical tools. Recently, I have been working on opto-electronic materials.

I enjoy developing theories and coding. All of the codes are open source and can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kazmorita).

This webpage is still under development, so if you have any questions feel free to contact me!
