Welcome to my homepage!

I am a theoretical material scientist based at the University of Pennsylvania.

I mainly use density function theory (DFT) calculations, machine learning models, tight-binding models, and other theoretical tools.
Recently, I have been working on non-linear optics, polarons and defects in semiconductors.

I enjoy developing theories and codes to pursue my research. All of the codes are open source and can be found on my [github](https://github.com/kazmorita). Feel free to use, edit, and copy them.

This webpage is still under development, so if you have any questions feel free to contact me!
